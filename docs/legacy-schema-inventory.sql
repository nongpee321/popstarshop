/*
  POPSTAR legacy SQL Server schema inventory

  Run only against an isolated, copied database attached as READ_ONLY.
  This script performs SELECT queries only. It does not create, alter,
  write, or delete any object or data.

  ISOLATION LEVEL - this matters for which results can be trusted:

    Sections 0-11 and 15, 18   metadata only. READ UNCOMMITTED is fine.
    Sections 12-14, 16, 17, 19 counts, amounts and business rows.
                               READ COMMITTED only. A dirty read can return
                               rows that are later rolled back, so a figure
                               taken that way cannot be reconciled against
                               anything and must never feed a UAT.

  The runner defaults to READ COMMITTED and only drops to READ UNCOMMITTED
  when asked with --dirty, which it refuses outright if the query touches any
  table outside sys / INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
